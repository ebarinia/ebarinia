## Emmanuel Barinia - Software Developer

### Hello World ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my Github!

I'm Emmanuel, a career-changer who's (recently) decided to make a drastic change to his life, quit his job and joined CodeClan/CodeBase to learn Software development along 14 other people. Needless to say, this whole experience has been met with a lot of challenges, but it's also opened my eyes and introduced me to the wonderful world of SWD.

In my spare time, you can usually still find me in front of the laptop... looking up and reading up about anything audio/video or playing some video games. I'm a natural tinkerer, and I love bridging the gap between software and hardware (from building arduino sketches, play around with a Raspberry Pi and building an Unraid NAS server to host several docker containers/database/website & media).

ðŸ¤” I'm currently looking for my first position as a developer within the industry.

ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, my details are on the left below my profile picture ðŸ˜ƒ
